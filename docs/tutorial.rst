Personal Trainer App Tutorial
=============================

On the home page of the Personal Trainer Application, the user can read about
the values that the company has, see the different pricing options, and
optionally they can submit a message to the trainer using the contact form.
On the navigation bar on the home page, the user can go to the "About" page to
learn more about the company.

There are three different types of membership options. Basic, Pro, and Premium.
Basic is the cheapest option, Pro is the middle option, and Premium is the
most expensive option.

Using either the "Register" link on the navigation bar, or using the "Sign Up"
links in the Pricing section on the home page, the user can sign up and make
an account. During registration the user will create a username and password.

Once the user is logged in they can view their Profile and make changes
to their information. Since this is a personal training application,
there are fields for the user to enter their weight, height, and they can
select their membership option. There are other fields such as phone, address,
and a section for notes in case the user wants to add some notes about them-
selves or about their membership.

Also, once the user is logged in they can now see extra links on the
navigation bar that lead to their workout program and their meal plan.
Currently these pages have a message that says "Your program will be up-
loaded within 24-48 hours" because I have not had a chance to create
fictional programs.

Lastly, when the user is logged in there is also a new "Contact" link on
the navigation bar so that they can contact their personal trainer.

If the user forgets their password or would like to reset it, they can use the 
"forgot password" link on the log in page.
